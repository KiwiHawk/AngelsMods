[tips-and-tricks-description]
angels-petrochem=A mod that overhauls petrochemical processing to be more complex and pseudo-realistic (not overly so).\nRaw resources have to be processed and transformed through chemical processing chains to gain:\n__1__\n The mod also adds a new well: __2__
angels-air-filtering=Oxygen and Nitrogen are key base materials for quite a lot of industrial processes, some of which are part of this mod. For example, using [fluid=angels-gas-oxygen] instead of raw air improves the efficiency of smelting processes. Therefore, being able to separate air into [fluid=angels-gas-oxygen] and [fluid=angels-gas-nitrogen] is a key technology.
angels-air-filtering-notes=\n\n[font=default-bold]NOTES[/font]: Earth’s atmosphere consists of roughly 21% Oxygen and 79% Nitrogen.\nThis mod uses a different ratio to reduce the early waste of nitrogen gas, and the late game waste of oxygen gas. We can do that because Nauvis is not Earth.
